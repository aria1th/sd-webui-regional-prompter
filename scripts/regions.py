"""
SBM mod: Two dimensional regions (of variable size, NOT a matrix).
- Adds keywords ADDROW, ADDCOL and respective delimiters for aratios.
- A/bratios become list dicts: Inner dict of cols (varying length list) + start/end + number of breaks,
  outer layer is rows list.
  First value in each row is the row's ratio, the rest are col ratios.
  This fits prompts going left -> right, top -> down. 
- Unrelated BREAKS are counted per cell, and later extracted as multiple context indices.
- Each layer is cut up by both row + col ratios.
- Style improvements: Created classes for rows + cells and functions for some of the splitting.
- Base prompt overhaul: Added keyword ADDBASE, when present will trigger "use_base" automatically;
  base is excluded from the main prompt for dim calcs; returned to start before hook (+ base break count);
  during hook, context index skips base break count + 1. Rest is applied normally.
- To specify cols first, use "vertical" mode. eg 1st col:2 rows, 2nd col:1 row.
  In effect, this merely reverses the order of iteration for every row/col loop and whatnot.

"""
SBM mod: Mask polygon region.
- Basically a version of inpainting, where polygon outlines are drawn and added to a coloured image.
- Colours from the image are picked apart for masks corresponding to regions.
- In new mask mode, masks are stored instead of aratios, and applied to each region forward.
- Mask can be uploaded (alpha, no save), and standard colours are detected from it.
- Uncoloured regions default to the first colour detected;
  however, if base mode is used, instead base will be applied to the remainder at 100% strength.
  I think this makes it far more useful. At 0 strength, it will apply ONLY to said regions.
- V2: Corrects and detects colours from upload.
- Mask mode presets save mask to a file, which is loaded with the preset.
- Added -1 colour to clear sections, an eraser.
